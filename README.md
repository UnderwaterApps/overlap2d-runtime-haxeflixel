# overlap2d-runtime-haxeflixel

This is an official runtime for loading scenes, created with Overlap2D Editor ( [http://overlap2d.com/](http://overlap2d.com/) ), and rendering them in [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/) framework.

Loading and rendering your scene is as easy as writing:

```as3
var sl:SceneLoader = new SceneLoader();
sl.loadScene("MainScene");
add(sl.getRoot());
```
